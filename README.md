*Solving the traveling salesman problem using heuristic algorithms.*

Scripts and reports for the **Heuristics and AI** course in EISTI.

We applied different AI algorithms (Particle Swarm Optimization, Simulated Annealing and Taboo Search) to both continuous and discrete optimization problems (e.g. Traveling Salesman Problem).
