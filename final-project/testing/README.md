Thsi folder contains the code to run the tests on the algorithms:

1. run the `surface_multi_evaluation` and the `benim_evaluation` scripts (they will take a while)

2. each will produce a file with the best result for each of the 30 iterations for each polygon.

3. run printres.py to produce the barplot and the overall best solutions.
